                        Hi Aditi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy. 
                    </h3>

                <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
                <p>
                    In this section I will talk about the structure of the website and the preferred way to access it. On the top there is 
                    a header which consists of five links namely <br>->Home<br>->Pandemic<br>->Stories<br>->About the site<br>->Who am I<br>
                    On the left side there is the birthday special section which has its links which are <br>
                    ->A gift<br>->A message<br>->A request<br>->An appreciation<br>->A compaint<br>
                    I would recommend you to go through "About this site" first then to birthday special section then go to the header links in any order you want to explore.
                    <br>At some pages you might find some google doc links. When I found out that I will not be able 
                    to use dbms(detailed info on "About this site" tab) I got this idea of interaction. If anything you find inappropriate 
                    it is because I don't know what to say and I have to fill the content quickly. Any way if you still have a problem, I can't help. It's you fault why are u so beautiful&#128522<br>One more thing it is only shared 
                    to you. No one knows about it.<br>=>If possible open it on computer, this site looks better on pc.<br><br><br><br>
