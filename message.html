                    <h3>
                        Hi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy.

                        than what it actually did i.e. just to wish someone a hbd. But it helped me knowing the true colour of the person.

                        => The meaning of every word which is not underlined(i.e. out of this box), has changed now. Actually this website was like last talk knowing
                        the fact that the person I'm communicating through this doesn't have space for me. I was (80-90)% sure about it but that 
                        remaining (10-20)% doubt was the real culprit that led me to the path of disaster that I couldn't imagine. <br><br>


                        =>This site will work as my motivation dose throughout my life. It comprises of all of my failures
                        including getting year back for no genuine reason to not making it to top 15 in district cricket despite being so close. From being rejected in NDA interview
                        on 5th day on two occasions to being highly insulted by the person whom I thought to just talk gently. I hate myself 
                        for choosing someone like the one I did to dedicate my work. <br><br>
                        
                        =>And here is my inspiration from the incident. Whatever happened I must forget but not the hard work I went through to 
                        make this website by learning from the begining to successfull deployment of the website within the deadline in the span of 5 days. It shows 
                        what I can achieve if I am focussed and determined. Just find a better reason to get a better outcome.

                <h2>Message- No message but a cool trick</h2>
                <p>
                    I have nothing to say in this section. Filling it in the very last so no words remaining from my side.
                    But I can tell you something that will help you a lot. 
                    Now a days there are tons of websites that we need to check in. In order to maintain the data they ask you
                    to register on their websites. I can say that if there are even lakhs of websites that I register I will 
                    never forget the password of any website at any point of time in life. How ?
                    <br> It's simple I use a technique where my password resides in the name the website itself and it's completely 
                    secure.<br><br>

                    Suppose you need to register on makemytrip.com then the current password norm says it should be atleat of 8 
                    character length, should consist of alphanumeric and a special character. So what we can do is that we can split 
                    the 8 length password into 5+3 in which the 5 characters will always be same following password norms. For example
                    "A276@" and for remaining three you can choose the characters from the given site name placed on your favourite 3 digit number
                    suppose your favourite 3 digit no is 591 the you choose the character at 5th position 9th position and 1st position as your reemaining
                    password characters. In our case 5th character in "makemytrip" is m, 9th is i and 1st is m. so my last three characters are mim 
                    and thus our password is  "A276@mim". Now what will be the password for swiggy. let's make it since we have selected the constant 
                    part as "A276@" we only need to find the last three characters on 591 rule. 5-'g' 9-since it doesnot have 9 characters put swiggy on loop 
                    and then find out 9th character you will find out 'w' comes at 9th position and 1st is 's' . so password="A276@gws" 
                    <br >The major drawback is that if a person saw your password and understands your trick he wil have access to  all your accounts.
                    So never let them know how are you selecting the password, what are your magical last three numbers and most imprtant of all never 
                    let the first five constant characters leak. By this way you don't need to remember any password. They are there. Tip: choose wisely 
                    your constants and last three.
