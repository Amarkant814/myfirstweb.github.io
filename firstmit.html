                        Hi Aditi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy. 
                    </h3>

                <h2>First time I saw You</h2>
                <p>
                    I had seen your name in freshers welcome notice about performance in dancing. I did not care that time. I didn't even 
                    see your performance but your name got noticed to me since you are titled "Shrivastava" and I also belong to kayastha family. For a moment 
                    I thought who is this girl. See I am not a castist but when you are a part of a system you inherit these properties of noticing someone
                    from same community.<br>
                    Few days later we were going to IIT Patna to play a cricket tournament and for a fraction of second I saw a pretty beautiful girl in our college through the bus window.
                    After the game was over I asked my junior I saw a gorgeous girl in our college, had never seen earlier, do you know anyone new?(It was the first
                    time I was taking interest in a girl)
                    He said I don't know whom you saw, but I know one from first year. And you know what, he took your name.<br>I was pretty normal that time because 
                    I had this perception that engineers always exaggerate the ladies and also I thought whatever she is in first year so "apne ko kya matlab". 
                    After some days I again heard your name then I searched you on fb and my reaction was like "yeah pretty girl" and for the first time I sent friend request to a junior
                    accepted it. But still there was a this senior junior doubt in my brain. Again after some days your name popped up and then I decided to find you out. Mid sem exam started and 
                    I found you out and saw you for the first time and the first words that came to my mind was "Omg the most beautiful girl I have seen ever..". Again outside the canteen I saw you 
                    and even you looked at me for a moment(maybe you don't remember but that moment was special for me) and I gazed into those deep calm eyes that 
                    changed me completely. Earlier I had never thought that in 3rd year(academically) I would be thinking about a girl. Because it was the time
                    to work hard and make up the loss that I had faced earlier.
