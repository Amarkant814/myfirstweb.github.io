                        Hi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy.

                        than what it actually did i.e. just to wish someone a hbd. But it helped me knowing the true colour of the person.

                        => The meaning of every word which is not underlined(i.e. out of this box), has changed now. Actually this website was like last talk knowing
                        the fact that the person I'm communicating through this doesn't have space for me. I was (80-90)% sure about it but that 
                        remaining (10-20)% doubt was the real culprit that led me to the path of disaster that I couldn't imagine. <br><br>


                        =>This site will work as my motivation dose throughout my life. It comprises of all of my failures
                        including getting year back for no genuine reason to not making it to top 15 in district cricket despite being so close. From being rejected in NDA interview
                        on 5th day on two occasions to being highly insulted by the person whom I thought to just talk gently. I hate myself 
                        for choosing someone like the one I did to dedicate my work. <br><br>
                        
                        =>And here is my inspiration from the incident. Whatever happened I must forget but not the hard work I went through to 
                        make this website by learning from the begining to successfull deployment of the website within the deadline in the span of 5 days. It shows 
                        what I can achieve if I am focussed and determined. Just find a better reason to get a better outcome.

                <h2>About this site</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of making a website came to my mind a few days ago when I was wondering how should I wish you on <del>**th</del>
                    of August. My initial stand was just a message "Happy birthday cute girl who turned into a mute girl" &#128517 but then I thought,
                    wait a minute if someone is on Read only mode then why not make your own platform where you have the freedom of speech. And here I am.
                    <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first tell you I had no idea how to make a website. Five days ago I did not know what is 
                    HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP.Net MVC, JSON, web hosting, deployment etc etc. I mean I had heard these things but never knew the exact functioning
                    of these in order to make an application. I know it's irrelevant to you but since I have to make content and to make content I have to say
                    all these. Now I realise I am not a good content writer. I am not a good designer too. 
                    <br/>
                    On that note let me tell you the journey of this site. In today's era anything we (engineers) have to achieve starts
                    with youtube videos. I also started watching all those html css javascript videos. It looked pretty simple that time 
                    but when I engaged myself started making it I realised it was not that straight forward. 
                    <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First problem : Designing a template <br/>
                    It had not been a while since I started making it that I stuck on designing the structure and moreover the colours. They really
                    faded up my brain. Any colour I was choosing looked bad or the text would not be that clear in the background. It stil 
                    has that issue but I am done with it, whatever it is, it's final.
                    Co-incidently it matched with the background image colours. Green leaves, your black dress and milky white face. Exactly 
                    these colours are used in the design.
                    <br>Another issue:Database and deployment<br>I wanted a dynamic website where the server can interact with the client
                    but that required a database but then deploying it was tricky. In case you don't know, deploying means publishing 
                    the codes that I have on my machine to a web hosting agency so that my website can be accessed to anyone. To understand the 
                    whole scenario of hosting and deployment took 2 days of workhour. Any video I was following resulted into some kind of 
                    failure. At last I found a combination of two to three videos to analyze the crucial steps and got successfull.
                    <br>Not over yet: Device issue <br>
                    The moment I thought I was ready to go, I found out that the website will open completely different on mobile
                    and all of my designing was just a mess in the monbile view. I had to redesign for the mobile browser as well.
                    Now when I code something with respect to mobile the desktop version would get hampered. This was real frustration.
                    Finally I found a middle ground where both get descent looks and my website was ready for deployment.
                    That moment was so pleasant knowing that my website can be accessed by anyone anywhere in the world.
                    <br>Last but not the least: Content<br> 
                    Now the real goal of any service is what goal it achieves in my case it was to say you hbd. But a website requires 
                    a lot to be delivered so I thought of these content what you see on the page. But these are also some kind of burden 
                    when you have to wake up whole night typing some thoughts without having a thought.
                    <br><br>Still what matters the most is the end result and I am very delighted to have it. I don't know if you will
                    read this far but if you are here then I have something to say. 
                    No matter how you react to this website, I will always be thankful to you for being the reason for me to start making something productive.
