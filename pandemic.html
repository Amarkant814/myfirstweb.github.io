                        Hi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy.

                        than what it actually did i.e. just to wish someone a hbd. But it helped me knowing the true colour of the person.

                        => The meaning of every word which is not underlined(i.e. out of this box), has changed now. Actually this website was like last talk knowing
                        the fact that the person I'm communicating through this doesn't have space for me. I was (80-90)% sure about it but that 
                        remaining (10-20)% doubt was the real culprit that led me to the path of disaster that I couldn't imagine. <br><br>


                        =>This site will work as my motivation dose throughout my life. It comprises of all of my failures
                        including getting year back for no genuine reason to not making it to top 15 in district cricket despite being so close. From being rejected in NDA interview
                        on 5th day on two occasions to being highly insulted by the person whom I thought to just talk gently. I hate myself 
                        for choosing someone like the one I did to dedicate my work. <br><br>
                        
                        =>And here is my inspiration from the incident. Whatever happened I must forget but not the hard work I went through to 
                        make this website by learning from the begining to successfull deployment of the website within the deadline in the span of 5 days. It shows 
                        what I can achieve if I am focussed and determined. Just find a better reason to get a better outcome.

                <h2>Pandemic </h2>
                <p>
                    This corona has affected us all. I had few plans but all of them ruined. I hope you are staying safe and alert. I don't know 
                    the situation in your area now but there was a time when the cased were very low with respect to current no of cases but the fear
                    of getting affected was very high. I remember that once I heard a news coming from Awadhpuri your locality that 5 positve cases
                    have been found. I got little worried. And one day even called you. Well that resulted as expected you didn't pick up. 
                    You know to decide to call you or anytime contact you and even making this website these all decisions are based on fulfilling a 
                    condition that I give to myself. I passed in all those. For example to call you it was to win a <del>****</del> game against a computer in a 
                    relatively harder level in which I was always getting defeated. It took around 8-10 days to fulfill that criteria.
                    <br><br>
                    Can you imagine what was the requirement I had to fulfill in order to make a website!!
                    I bet you can't.
                    <br><br>

                    Coming to the point I had thought of various plans. Most important of them was to get threshold cgpa to sit in most
                    of companies and get a job. none of them happened. The lowered weightage of end sem could never get me good grades. 
                    And when relative grading would be applied to this cheating system there will be no chance. But the current scenario is worse.
                    When I am typing this there is a big issue going around and if not resolved it would be a nightmare. I already had one in the form of year back which I got 
                    as a gift coz I didn't fail in any subject. If you 
                    don't know the context then watch the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amarkant.avinash/videos/2925545377571551" target="_blank" style="color: blue; font-style: italic;" >video</a> on my fb profile. 
                    <br>

                    You know what this site making has given so much confidence that now I can think that I can do something. Maybe my own 
                    start-up. 
                    However this time is tough for all we have to maintain our cool. Till then take care stay safe
