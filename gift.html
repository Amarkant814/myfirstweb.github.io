                    <h3>
                        Hi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy.

                    <h3><u>->This is my first website and I decide not to abandon it. It was created to serve a purpose completely different 
                        than what it actually did i.e. just to wish someone a hbd. But it helped me knowing the true colour of the person. 
                        <br><br>
                        
                        -> The meaning of every word which is not underlined(i.e. out of this box), has changed now. Actually this website was like last talk knowing
                        the fact that the person I'm communicating through this doesn't have space for me. I was (80-90)% sure about it but that 
                        remaining (10-20)% doubt was the real culprit that led me to the path of disrespect that I faced. <br><br>


                        ->This will work as my motivation dose throughout my life. It comprises of all of my failures
                        including getting year back for no genuine reason to not making it to top 15 in district cricket despite being so close. From being rejected in NDA interview
                        on 5th day on two occasions to being highly insulted by the person whom I thought to just talk gently. I hate myself 
                        for choosing someone like the one I did to dedicate my work. <br><br>
                        
                        ->And here is my inspiration from the incident. Whatever happened I must forget but not the hard work I went through to 
                        make this website by learning from the begining to successfull deployment of the website within the deadline in the span of 5 days. It shows 
                        what I can achieve if I am focussed and determined. Just find a better reason to get a better outcome.

                <p>
                    Well people getting gifts on birthday is a norm and to be a part of it I have designed this column(However the whole website belongs to you, it is also a gift from my side). 
                    I am embeding this photograph.<br> What more valuable than precious memories. You might be getting your 
                    birthday wishes attached with a photo of yours from all your contacts. How about someone completely out of the nowhere attaching 
                    this photo where I insist that the cute little girl drown in thoughts of parallel universe(in her own world) is you . This has been my favourite.
                    Spotting it was like a big achievement.
