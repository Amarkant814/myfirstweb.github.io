                    <h3>
                        Hi Aditi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy.
                    </h3>

                <h2>Who am I - I don't know </h2>
                <p>
                    Well since I have to make some content I thought of adding this option as well. I don't know why. Maybe if you get curious 
                    who was the crazy person who created a website to wish me on my birthday. So this section welcomes you first. Here basically I will talk 
                    about my college life. I prepared for Jee but could not crack it and got Nitp. I did not repeat, took admission in my first try.
                    But I was disappointed with it. I thought of giving jee paper again and I got even better score than my previous year.
                    But not good enough to get a seat. Belonging to general category  stopped me from addmission iin ISM Dhanbad. ISM Dhanbad because
                    a friend of mine scoring same marks got a seat there. He was from OBC. I hate this reservation system. Whatever I had to satisfy with 
                    this college.<br>
                    In initial days I used to miss my friends(basically my best friend) a lot from school days. 
                     <br> <br>
                    
                    I am a normal person who likes to be quite straight forward. I love playing cricket. Most of the time I create my friend circle 
                    with cricket. When I was in first year I just used to attend class and comeback to room. But playing cricket gave me the reason I 
                    started to involve in the group. First year was going awesome but then something unusal happened and I was awarded a year back(in an unconventional manner i.e. I didn't fail..to know more goto pandemic section) and it 
                    changed my life style completely. I tried three ways to get out of college and get indulged in other streams. I gave NDA exam cleared 
                    written but in interview when the interviewer asked why do you want to join now you are well placed in nit patna. I had no satisfactory 
                    answer to that question. I was eliminated on the 5th day(Conference out). <br>[It was held in Bhopal. I hadn't much time to roam but I visited the lakes. I think there is a place
                    called peoples mall. I found it online and I was very interested to go there but was low on time. Couldn't make it. However, I enjoyed those days]
                    <br><br>I tried playing cricket and even was ready to get into it professionally got selected in district top 30 but 
                    could not make it to top 15. Those players were well trained from some big cities.<br>
                    I registered for IGNOU distance learning and paid the admission fee but they said it had not been paid so can't enroll.
                    If that day I had been enrolled to IGNOU then I would not have been writing this text today. Interestingly when I decided
                    nothing gonna work I will have to go back to nitp, two months later IGNOU sends the registration slip and study material.
                    WOW!! till then it was very late.<br>

                    I learnt gradually how to deal with it but I missed the most important aspects of college life "my friends". Only fiend who used to play 
                    cricket with me remained there for me. <br>New class stinged to me. I never made friends there. Till now I don't know the names 
                    of most of guys. I decided to keep it this way to always make me realise that I do not belong here. I had no interest in talking to any girls.
                    But then you entered. Continued in "Stories" section.
