                        Hi Aditi!
                        <br/> Its my first website ever created by me and it's dedicated to you on the occasion of your birthday.
                       The only intention behind it is to make your day special and also enhance my coding skills. &#128522
                       <br/>There were many occasions when I thought why am I doing this that girl does'nt even want to talk. But I had to wish birthday also so
                       I remained determined to this project and decided to 
                       create it no matter what and I realized I have never worked this hard in my life and once I initiated it the first thing to be done was to 
                       set background image and the image worked as a motivation to me. Everytime I thought of abandoning it there was someone smiling and saying "tumse na ho payega "&#128514 &#128514
                       <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am writing this I am completely exhausted and have no more time to think what impact my words are going to make. I am writing whatever comes to my mind in the 
                       first place without giving a second thought so take it easy.
                    </h3>

                <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
                <p>
                    The very first thing I would ask you to tell me what did you feel after looking at this wwebsite 
                    Now if you  are not that mad at me I would like you to do me a favor by playing an online game of chess with me.
                    I really wish if I could play it with you someday. In this lockdown period I have been so bored without cricket 
                    that everything seems annoying. Only chess has been a source of entertainment these days for me. And after I 
                    started playing I got a bit addicted to it day by day. Now a days I have controlled myself from this game otherwise I 
                    would just keep on playing all the time. I was getting better at it. Most of the time when I am winning I just make a 
                    blunder and spoil the game and when I lose a winning game, the frustration is so intolerable. Now one time I want to 
                    play with you and see if I have learnt enough to stand a chance against you.
